Real-time Data Processing Pipeline using Apache Kafka

Description: The objective of this project is to build a real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka as the messaging system. The pipeline will be used to ingest streaming data from multiple sources, process it, and store it in a data warehouse for further analysis.

Tools used:

Apache Kafka as the messaging system
Python as the primary programming language
Apache Spark for data processing
AWS S3 as the data storage system
Airflow for workflow management

Steps involved in the project:

Setting up an Apache Kafka cluster
Writing a Python script to ingest streaming data from various sources
Configuring Apache Spark to process the data in real-time
Implementing a custom serializer and deserializer to process data in JSON format
Storing the processed data in AWS S3
Creating Airflow DAGs to orchestrate the data pipeline
Expected Outcome:
The project aims to build a scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time data processing pipeline using Apache Kafka. The pipeline will be able to handle high-volume, high-velocity data streams from multiple sources and store it in a data warehouse for further analysis. It will enable data analysts and data scientists to gain insights from streaming data in real-time, which can be used for decision making and driving business growth.
