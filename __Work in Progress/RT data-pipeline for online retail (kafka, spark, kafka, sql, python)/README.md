Project title: Real-time big data processing and analysis for online retail

Project description:
This project involves building a real-time data processing and analysis pipeline for an online retail business. The pipeline will ingest, process, and analyze large amounts of data from various sources such as web logs, sales data, and customer feedback.

Tools and technologies:

Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and ingestion
Apache Spark for distributed processing and analysis
Apache Hadoop for distributed storage and processing
Python for data processing and analysis
SQL for querying and data manipulation

Steps involved:

Set up a Kafka cluster and create Kafka topics for ingesting data from various sources.
Write Kafka producers to feed data from sources such as web logs, sales data, and customer feedback into the Kafka topics.
Create Kafka consumers to read the data from the Kafka topics and process it in real-time using Apache Spark Streaming.
Use Spark to perform various analyses on the data, such as identifying trends in customer behavior, monitoring inventory levels, and predicting sales.
Store the processed data in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for future analysis.
Use SQL to query and manipulate the data stored in HDFS.

Challenges:

Managing the high volume and velocity of data generated by online retail businesses.
Ensuring the real-time processing and analysis of data to enable timely decision-making.
Implementing fault-tolerant and scalable systems to handle data processing and storage.
Designing efficient data models and data processing workflows to optimize performance.

Benefits:

Showcase your expertise in multiple data engineering tools and programming languages.
Demonstrate your ability to handle complex and real-time data processing and analysis tasks.
Develop skills in data modeling, distributed processing, and big data technologies.
Gain practical experience in building a complete data pipeline from data ingestion to storage and analysis.
Note: This project requires significant time and effort to complete. However, it can serve as a strong demonstration of your skills and experience to potential employers.
