## Ingesting Data from Alpha Vantage and Storing it in a MongoDB Database using Apache Kafka.

### Here are the high-level steps to follow for ingesting data from Alpha Vantage and storing it in a MongoDB database using Apache Kafka:

*Prerequisites* <br>
- Sign up for an Alpha Vantage API key: If you haven't already, sign up for a free API key from Alpha Vantage. You will need this key to access their API and retrieve financial data.<br>

- Set up a Kafka cluster: Set up a Kafka cluster using your preferred cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure. You will need at least one Kafka broker and one ZooKeeper instance.<br>

- Set up a MongoDB instance: Set up a MongoDB instance using your preferred cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure. You will use this instance to store the data that you ingest from Alpha Vantage.<br>

*Steps*<br>
- Create a Kafka topic: Create a Kafka topic to store the data that you will ingest from Alpha Vantage. This topic will be the source of data for the Kafka producer.<br>

- Set up a Kafka producer: Use a Kafka producer to fetch data from Alpha Vantage's API and write it to the Kafka topic that you created in the previous step. You can use any programming language with a Kafka client library to implement the Kafka producer.<br>

- Set up a Kafka consumer: Use a Kafka consumer to read data from the Kafka topic and write it to your MongoDB instance. You can use any programming language with a Kafka client library and a MongoDB driver to implement the Kafka consumer.<br>

- Run the Kafka producer: Run the Kafka producer to fetch data from Alpha Vantage's API and write it to the Kafka topic.<br>

- Run the Kafka consumer: Run the Kafka consumer to read data from the Kafka topic and write it to your MongoDB instance.<br>

- Monitor the pipeline: Monitor the pipeline to ensure that data is being ingested correctly and that there are no issues with your Kafka cluster or MongoDB instance.<br>

- That's it! With these steps, you should be able to ingest data from Alpha Vantage and store it in a MongoDB database using Apache Kafka.<br>
