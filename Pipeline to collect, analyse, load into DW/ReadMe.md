Build a data pipeline to collect, process and analyze data from multiple sources (e.g. API, CSV files, database) and load it into a data warehouse. The data warehouse could be hosted on cloud platforms like AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery or Azure Synapse.

The project could involve the following steps:

1. Identify data sources: Determine the sources of data you want to collect and analyze. This could be from public APIs, web scraping or from internal databases.

2. Design data model: Design a database schema that can store the data collected from various sources. The schema should be optimized for the queries that will be run on the data.

3. Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) process: Write scripts or use ETL tools like Apache Airflow, AWS Glue or Google Cloud Dataflow to extract data from the sources, transform it into the required format and load it into the data warehouse.

4. Data validation: Validate the data to ensure it meets quality standards and is accurate.

5. Data analysis: Once the data is in the warehouse, perform data analysis to generate insights and visualize the data.

6. Automate the process: Schedule the ETL process to run at regular intervals and set up alerts for data quality issues.
